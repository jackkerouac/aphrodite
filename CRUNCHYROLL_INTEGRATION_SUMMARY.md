## Data Sources Used

### Crunchyroll Awards Data
- **File**: `crunchyroll_anime_awards_enhanced.json`
- **Contains**: 11 anime winners with TMDb IDs
- **Detection**: Matches by TMDb TV/Movie ID first, then title/variants

### Notable Winners Included
- Solo Leveling (TMDb: 127532) - 2025 Anime of the Year
- Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba (TMDb: 85937) - Multiple years winner
- Attack on Titan (TMDb: 1429) - 2025 Global Impact Award
- Jujutsu Kaisen (TMDb: 95479) - 2021, 2024 winner
- My Hero Academia (TMDb: 65930) - 2018 multiple awards

### Image Files
- **Location**: `images/awards/[color]/crunchyroll.png`
- **Available Colors**: black, gray, red, yellow
- **Status**: ✅ Verified crunchyroll.png exists in all color directories

## Integration Flow

1. **Badge Detection**: When processing an item, `AwardsDataSource.get_tv_awards()` is called
2. **Crunchyroll Check**: `check_crunchyroll_awards()` searches the JSON by TMDb ID or title
3. **Award Priority**: If multiple awards found, Crunchyroll has "High" priority (after Oscars/Cannes/Golden Globe/BAFTA/Emmy)
4. **Badge Application**: If Crunchyroll award detected, applies `crunchyroll.png` badge from selected color scheme
5. **Positioning**: Awards badges use flush bottom-right positioning (no padding)

## Testing

Run the integration test:
```bash
cd /path/to/aphrodite
python test_crunchyroll_integration.py
```

The test validates:
- ✅ Crunchyroll awards data loads correctly
- ✅ Known winners are detected properly
- ✅ Non-winners are not falsely detected
- ✅ Image files exist in all color schemes
- ✅ Badge settings include Crunchyroll configuration

## Usage

Crunchyroll awards will now be automatically detected for anime that have won Crunchyroll Anime Awards when:

1. **Awards badges are enabled** in badge settings
2. **Crunchyroll is selected** as an award source in settings
3. **The anime has won** a Crunchyroll award (based on the JSON data)
4. **TMDb ID or title matches** the awards database

The badge will appear as a flush-positioned ribbon in the bottom-right corner using the selected color scheme.
