# Summary of changes made to fix the remote machine API issue

echo "üîß Aphrodite Remote Machine Fix - Summary of Changes"
echo "=================================================="
echo ""

echo "üìã Problem Identified:"
echo "   - Frontend was using hardcoded 'localhost:8000' for API calls"
echo "   - This caused failures when running on remote machines (192.168.0.110)"
echo "   - Dashboard showed 'Offline' status, Settings couldn't save, etc."
echo ""

echo "üõ†Ô∏è Changes Made:"
echo ""

echo "1. Updated Next.js Configuration (frontend/next.config.ts):"
echo "   ‚úÖ Made API rewrites conditional on environment"
echo "   ‚úÖ Use relative URLs in production"
echo "   ‚úÖ Only rewrite in development mode"
echo ""

echo "2. Fixed API Service (frontend/src/services/api.ts):"
echo "   ‚úÖ Dynamic URL resolution based on environment"
echo "   ‚úÖ Uses window.location.origin in production"
echo "   ‚úÖ All API calls now use buildApiUrl() helper"
echo ""

echo "3. Updated Environment Configuration (frontend/.env.production):"
echo "   ‚úÖ Set NODE_ENV=production for builds"
echo "   ‚úÖ Empty NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL for relative URLs"
echo ""

echo "4. Created Build Scripts:"
echo "   ‚úÖ build-frontend-fixed.sh - Proper production build"
echo "   ‚úÖ test-api-fix.sh - Verify URL resolution logic"
echo ""

echo "üéØ How the Fix Works:"
echo ""
echo "   Development: Frontend ‚Üí http://localhost:8000/api"
echo "   Production:  Frontend ‚Üí \${window.location.origin}/api"
echo ""
echo "   On 192.168.0.110:8000 ‚Üí http://192.168.0.110:8000/api ‚úÖ"
echo "   On localhost:8000     ‚Üí http://localhost:8000/api ‚úÖ"
echo "   On any-domain.com     ‚Üí https://any-domain.com/api ‚úÖ"
echo ""

echo "üöÄ Deployment Steps:"
echo "1. Run the build script:"
echo "   ./build-frontend-fixed.sh"
echo ""
echo "2. Rebuild the Docker container:"
echo "   docker-compose build --no-cache"
echo ""
echo "3. Deploy and test on remote machine (192.168.0.110)"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ Expected Results After Fix:"
echo "   - Dashboard shows correct API status"
echo "   - Settings page can save configurations"
echo "   - Poster Manager and Preview pages work"
echo "   - Schedules page loads properly"
echo "   - All API communication works on any hostname/IP"
echo ""

echo "üîç Testing Instructions:"
echo "After deployment, verify these work on http://192.168.0.110:8000:"
echo "   ‚ñ° Dashboard shows 'Online' API status"
echo "   ‚ñ° Settings page loads and saves"
echo "   ‚ñ° Poster Manager page loads"
echo "   ‚ñ° Preview page works"
echo "   ‚ñ° Schedules page loads data"
echo "   ‚ñ° Browser console shows no API errors"
