# Aphrodite Poster Restore Feature Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented a feature that allows users to restore all modified posters back to their original versions. This feature is integrated into the existing Aphrodite web interface through the "Poster Management" section.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

**File: `aphrodite-web/app/api/process.py`**
- Added new imports: `shutil` and `pathlib.Path`
- Added `/api/process/restore-originals` POST endpoint
- Added `/api/process/cleanup` POST endpoint (to support existing frontend functionality)
- Both endpoints use background threading and job tracking for consistent UX
- Docker-aware path detection (checks for `/app` directory vs local `posters` directory)

### Frontend Changes

**File: `aphrodite-web/frontend/src/components/execute/CleanupForm.vue`**
- Renamed component from "Clean Up Posters" to "Poster Management"
- Added tabbed interface with "Clean Up Posters" and "Restore Originals" tabs
- Added restore functionality with appropriate warnings and UI
- Maintained all existing cleanup functionality
- Added API call to the new restore endpoint

**File: `aphrodite-web/frontend/src/views/ExecuteView.vue`**
- Updated tab name from "Clean Up Posters" to "Poster Management"
- Enhanced results display to show restore-specific statistics (restored count, errors, etc.)
- Added cleanup-specific statistics display as well
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing result formats

## How It Works

### Restore Process
1. User clicks "Restore Original Posters" button in the Poster Management tab
2. Frontend makes POST request to `/api/process/restore-originals`
3. Backend creates a background job and returns job ID immediately
4. Background thread:
   - Scans `posters/original/` directory for all files
   - For each original file, copies it to `posters/modified/` (overwriting the modified version)
   - Tracks success/error count for each operation
   - Updates job status with detailed results
5. Frontend displays progress and results with statistics

### Key Features
- **Non-blocking**: Uses background jobs so UI remains responsive
- **Docker-compatible**: Automatically detects Docker vs development environment paths
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handles individual file failures and reports them
- **Detailed feedback**: Shows restored count, total processed, and any errors
- **Safe operation**: Only overwrites files that exist in both directories

### File Structure Impact
- **Source**: `posters/original/` (unchanged)
- **Target**: `posters/modified/` (files replaced with originals)
- **No impact**: `posters/working/` directory is untouched

## Usage

1. Navigate to Execute â†’ Poster Management
2. Click "Restore Originals" tab
3. Review the warning message
4. Click "Restore Original Posters" button
5. Monitor progress and results in the results section below

The feature integrates seamlessly with the existing job system and provides the same level of feedback and error handling as other Aphrodite operations.
