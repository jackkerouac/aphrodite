Track your total media collection size with live counts of items in your library. The dashboard displays your complete media inventory at a glance - whether you have hundreds or thousands of items.

**Active Job Tracking**  
Monitor currently running processing jobs with live counters. See exactly how many poster enhancement tasks are actively being processed by your system workers.

**Daily Completion Metrics**  
Track your productivity with daily completion statistics showing how many posters have been successfully enhanced in the current day.

**Recent Activity Feed**  
The centerpiece activity log shows your latest batch processing operations with:
- **Batch Processing Jobs**: Chronological list of recent poster enhancement runs
- **Completion Status**: Visual progress bars and status badges for each job

## Dashboard Benefits

The Dashboard eliminates guesswork from media management by providing instant visibility into every aspect of your poster enhancement system. Whether you're checking on a long-running batch job, verifying system health, or monitoring daily progress, everything you need is available at a glance.

The clean, dark interface reduces eye strain during extended monitoring sessions, while the organized card layout makes it easy to quickly scan for the information you need most.

## At a Glance Metrics

From the Dashboard, you can instantly see:
- Total media items in your library (2,001+ items shown in example)
- Current processing activity (0 active jobs indicates system at rest)
- Daily enhancement progress (completion counters reset daily)
- Recent batch processing history with full completion status
- System health across all integrated services

The Dashboard transforms complex system monitoring into an intuitive, visual experience that keeps you informed without overwhelming you with unnecessary details.
